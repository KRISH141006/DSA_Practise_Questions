// Introduction and Array Implementation of Queue
// Last Updated : 23 Jul, 2025
// Similar to Stack, Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed for storing data. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). One can imagine a queue as a line of people waiting to receive something in sequential order which starts from the beginning of the line.

// It is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end which is known as the rear and deletions are done from the other end known as the front.
// A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 
// The difference between stack and queue is in removing an element. In a stack we remove the item that is most recently added while in a queue, we remove the item that is least recently added.
